autocomplete:
    needs 2 modules:
        one for pacman: use pacman -Ss, parse output and fuzzy search for name (it will include descriptions by default so manual name search is required)
        one for the aur: learn how their API works
        make sure to rate limit how often requests can be sent (when doing auto searches). Dont want to pull a manjaro.

Parsing args:
    full commands dont need extra logic
    small commands will work like a sort of search function:
    take -Rdo for example:
        -R will put you in the remove section
            d will put you in the dependency section
                o will tell it to remove orphaned dependencies.
    or -Io
        -I will put you in the install section
            o will tell it to output a package to the file
            (see how o can be reused because the initial command -I switched the section)
